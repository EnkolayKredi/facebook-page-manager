One of the ideas that has been floated is to make deep cuts in foreign aid—the investments that America makes to help other countries fight poverty and disease.\n\nThat would be a big mistake.\n\nFor one thing, these programs amount to less than 1 percent of the federal budget. For anyone worried about the budget deficit, cutting 1 percent will not make a dent.\n\nMore importantly, these programs give American taxpayers a phenomenal return on investment, one of the best anywhere in government.\n\nThey do this in three ways:\n\n1. Making Americans safer and the world more stable\n\n2. Creating jobs at home and promote trading partners that will buy American goods\n\n3. Saving lives and building up health systems so other countries can take better care of their people\n\nTogether these three points make the strategic case for aid—the argument that aid helps the countries that give it as well as those that receive it.\n\nThese are the arguments I have been making in Washington on behalf of American aid. All reasons why I believe this money is well-spent and ought to be maintained.'}, {'created_time': '2017-05-19T21:52:31+0000', 'story': 'Bill Gates with Melinda Gates.', 'message': 'Honored to welcome Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Seattle this week.', 'id': '216311481960_10154558167016961'}, {'created_time': '2017-05-19T12:07:00+0000', 'id': '216311481960_10154556816776961', 'message': 'I was lucky to be in my early 20s when the digital revolution was just getting under way, and Paul Allen and I had the chance to help shape it. \n\nIf I were starting out today and looking for the same kind of opportunity to make a big impact in the world, I would consider these fields: http://b-gat.es/2pHLHGa'}, {'created_time': '2017-05-18T17:15:33+0000', 'id': '216311481960_10154554744101961', 'message': 'Foreign aid gives American taxpayers a phenomenal return on investment, one of the best anywhere in government.'}, {'created_time': '2017-05-18T02:26:00+0000', 'id': '216311481960_10154553014406961', 'message': 'An incredible feat...\n\nThanks to India’s leadership, vaccines will help protect millions of kids against pneumonia: http://b-gat.es/2qtmVqf'}, {'created_time': '2017-05-17T16:26:17+0000', 'story': "Bill Gates shared Red Nose Day USA's video.", 'message': 'Red Nose Day is coming…pass it on.', 'id': '216311481960_10154551514066961'}, {'created_time': '2017-05-15T23:09:00+0000', 'id': '216311481960_10154546557056961', 'message': 'College seniors just accomplished something I never managed to do—earn a college degree.\n\nHere’s my advice for the Class of 2017…'}, {'created_time': '2017-05-14T13:13:00+0000', 'id': '216311481960_10154542469646961', 'message': 'Happy Mother’s Day, Melinda Gates!
